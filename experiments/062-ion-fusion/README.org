* Amazon Ion Primer

** What is Ion?

From Amazon's perspective:
- Self-describing data format
- Superset of JSON
- Binary and text representations
- Rich type system
- Annotations

** Ion vs JSON

#+begin_src ion
// JSON-like
{name: "Alice", age: 30}

// Ion with type annotations
{
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  email: user::"alice@example.com",  // Annotated string
  created: 2025-10-04T12:00:00Z      // Timestamp type
}
#+end_src

** Ion Type System

- Null
- Boolean
- Integer (arbitrary precision)
- Decimal (arbitrary precision)
- Float
- Timestamp
- String
- Symbol
- Blob/Clob
- List
- Struct

* Ion Fusion Concepts

** Data/Code Unification

The central thesis: persistent data and code should share semantics.

#+begin_example
Traditional:
  Data: JSON/XML/Protobuf (separate from code)
  Code: Python/Java/etc (transforms data)

Ion Fusion:
  Data: Ion structures (with semantics)
  Code: Ion transformations (unified with data)
#+end_example

** Customizable Language

- Not one-size-fits-all
- Adapted to Amazon's needs
- Evolved over 12+ years (2013-2025)
- Domain-specific customizations

** Production Use Cases

1. *Analytics*: Data queries and transformations
2. *Data Processing*: ETL pipelines
3. *Workflows*: State machines and orchestration

* Scheme/Racket Influence

** PLT Scheme Background

Todd's education at Rice (PLT):
- Functional programming foundations
- Macro systems
- Language-oriented programming
- First-class everything

** Racket Connections

Likely influences on Ion Fusion:
- ~#lang~ paradigm (customizable languages)
- S-expression-like data representation
- Homoiconicity (data is code, code is data)
- Macros for domain-specific patterns

** Language Evolution

Sustainable evolution through:
- Clear semantics
- Composable abstractions
- Backward compatibility considerations
- Incremental migration paths

* Questions for Session

1. How does Ion Fusion handle schema evolution at Amazon scale?
2. What are the macro/metaprogramming capabilities?
3. How does Ion Fusion compare to ~#lang~ Racket?
4. What were the biggest challenges in unifying data/code semantics?
5. How do teams adopt Ion Fusion? Training? Migration?
6. What's the relationship to other Amazon languages (Topaz, etc.)?
7. Type system: Static? Dynamic? Gradual?
8. Performance characteristics vs traditional approaches?

* Practical Exploration

** Learning Ion Format

#+begin_src bash
# Install Ion libraries (if available)
raco pkg install ion-data  # (hypothetical)

# Or explore Amazon Ion specification
# https://amazon-ion.github.io/ion-docs/
#+end_src

** Simulating Ion in Racket

#+begin_src racket
#lang racket

;; Ion-like data structures in Racket

(struct ion-value (type data annotations) #:transparent)

(define (ion-string str [annotations '()])
  (ion-value 'string str annotations))

(define (ion-timestamp ts)
  (ion-value 'timestamp ts '()))

(define (ion-struct fields [annotations '()])
  (ion-value 'struct fields annotations))

;; Example
(ion-struct
  (hash 'name (ion-string "Alice")
        'email (ion-string "alice@example.com" '(user))
        'created (ion-timestamp "2025-10-04T12:00:00Z")))
