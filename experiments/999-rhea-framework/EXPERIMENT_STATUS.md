| #16 | 043 | Lens-based Updates | @dsp-dr | IN_PROGRESS |

## Completed (Closed)

All experiments 000-008, 045-048, 061 have been completed with:
- Hypothesis validated
- Code artifacts in place
- GitHub issues documented
- Links to follow-up experiments

## Next Steps

Assignees should:
1. Review RHEA framework documentation: `experiments/999-rhea-framework/README.org`
2. Structure experiment using 3-phase approach (Hypothesis, Experiment, Analysis)
3. Implement code artifacts
4. Run statistical validation
5. Export results to org-mode
6. Update GitHub issue with findings
7. Close issue and link to next experiments

## RHEA Framework Usage

```racket
(define-hypothesis your-hypothesis
  [#:description "Your research question"]
  [#:assumes "Assumption 1" "Assumption 2"]
  [#:predicts "Prediction 1"])

(run-experiment your-test
  [#:tests your-hypothesis]
  [#:setup (λ () ...)]
  [#:procedure (λ (env) ...)]
  [#:replicate 100])
```

See example in `experiments/999-rhea-framework/rhea.rkt`
