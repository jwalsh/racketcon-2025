#+AUTHOR: Jason Walsh
#+DATE: 2025-10-04
#+STARTUP: overview

* Overview

The RHEA (Racket Hypothesis-Experiment-Analysis) Framework has been successfully implemented in three languages (Racket, Guile 3, Python 3.13) to provide a systematic approach to conducting programming language experiments.

* GitHub Issues Created

** Issue Template Structure
Each issue follows the RHEA three-phase structure:

1. *HYPOTHESIS*
   - Research Question
   - Background
   - Hypothesis Statement
   - Success Criteria
   - Dependencies

2. *EXPERIMENT*
   - Status (PLANNED/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED/BLOCKED/CLOSED)
   - Code Artifacts
   - Setup and Procedure

3. *ANALYSIS*
   - Results
   - Validation (Supported/Refuted/Inconclusive)
   - Key Findings
   - Limitations
   - Next Experiments

* Framework Implementations

** Racket Implementation (rhea.rkt)
- Native structs with gen:custom-write
- DSL macros: ~define-hypothesis~, ~run-experiment~
- syntax-parse for ergonomic syntax
- Statistical analysis primitives
- Org-mode export with Mermaid diagrams

** Guile 3 Implementation (rhea.scm)
- SRFI-9 records for data structures
- SRFI-1 (list operations), SRFI-19 (date/time)
- Pattern matching with ice-9 match
- Functional API design
- Compatible with Guile 3.0.10.24-bce91-dirty

** Python 3.13 Implementation (rhea.py)
- Dataclasses for type-safe structures
- Pattern matching (introduced in 3.10)
- Type hints with typing module
- Enum for experiment states
- Statistics module integration

* Cross-Language Comparison

| Feature | Racket | Guile 3 | Python 3.13 |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Data Structures | structs + macros | SRFI-9 records | dataclasses |
| Pattern Matching | match | match (ice-9) | match (3.10+) |
| Metaprogramming | syntax-parse | define-syntax | decorators |
| Type Safety | contracts | runtime checks | type hints |
| Statistical | manual | manual | statistics module |
| Export Format | org-mode | org-mode | org-mode |

* Example Usage

** Racket
#+begin_src racket
(define-hypothesis lens-composition
  [#:description "Lens composition preserves lens laws"]
  [#:assumes "Individual lenses satisfy GetPut, PutGet, PutPut"]
  [#:predicts "Composed lenses satisfy all three lens laws"])

(run-experiment lens-law-test
  [#:tests lens-composition]
  [#:setup (λ () (hash 'test-data '(1 2 3 4 5)))]
  [#:procedure test-lens-laws]
  [#:replicate 100])
#+end_src

** Guile 3
#+begin_src scheme
(define lens-composition
  (create-hypothesis 'lens-composition
    "Lens composition preserves lens laws"
    '("Individual lenses satisfy GetPut, PutGet, PutPut")
    '("Composed lenses satisfy all three lens laws")
    '((domain . functional-programming))))

(define observations
  (execute-experiment lens-law-test 100))
#+end_src

** Python 3.13
#+begin_src python
lens_composition = Hypothesis(
    id="lens_composition",
    description="Lens composition preserves lens laws",
    assumptions=["Individual lenses satisfy GetPut, PutGet, PutPut"],
    predictions=["Composed lenses satisfy all three lens laws"],
    metadata={'domain': 'functional_programming'}
)

observations = execute_experiment(lens_law_test, replicates=100)
#+end_src

* Workflow Integration

** GitHub Issues
- Each experiment tracked as issue
- Labels for phase and state
- Cross-references between related experiments
- Closed when all success criteria met

** Org-Mode Export
- Literate programming documents
- Embedded code blocks (tangled)
- Mermaid workflow diagrams
- Statistical results tables

** Mermaid Diagram Example
#+begin_src mermaid
graph TD
  H[Hypothesis] --> E[Experiment]
  E --> O[Observations]
  O --> A[Analysis]
  A --> R{Refine Hypothesis}
  R -->|Supported| H2[New Hypothesis]
  R -->|Rejected| H3[Alternative Hypothesis]
#+end_src

* Statistical Analysis

** Implemented Tests
1. *Mean*: Arithmetic mean of observations
2. *Variance*: Sample variance
3. *Standard Deviation*: sqrt(variance)
4. *t-test*: One-sample t-test (simplified)
5. *ANOVA*: Placeholder for future implementation

** Interpretation Logic
- Significant: Test statistic exceeds critical value
- Not Significant: Fails to reject null hypothesis
- Inconclusive: Insufficient data or undefined

* Applications to Existing Experiments

** Track 1: Rosette/Formal Methods (001-020)
- Experiments 000-008 completed and closed
- Statistical verification of solver performance
- Hypothesis refinement based on constraint complexity

** Track 3: Lenses/Pattern Matching (041-060)
- Experiments 041, 043 in progress
- Experiments 045-048 completed and closed
- Property-based testing validates lens laws
- Cross-language ports demonstrate universality

** Track 4: Data Formats (061-075)
- Experiment 061 completed
- Ion format evaluation against JSON/EDN
- Schema validation experiments pending

* Next Steps

** Short-term
1. Apply RHEA to experiments 041, 043 (in progress)
2. Generate cross-experiment dependency graph
3. Create labels in GitHub for phase tracking
4. Implement ANOVA and chi-square tests

** Medium-term
1. Add experiments for remaining tracks (9-20)
2. Integrate with CI/CD for automated testing
3. Build visualization dashboard
4. Create experiment search/filter interface

** Long-term
1. Publish RHEA as standalone library
2. Write paper on framework methodology
3. Create tutorials and documentation
4. Build community of experiment contributors
