Scope of Changes:

Documentation Link Fixes:
- Fixed 6 file links in docs/EMACS-RACKET-SETUP.org to use relative paths from docs/
- Fixed 3 file links in docs/SESSION_SUMMARY.org to reference parent directory
- Improved link description in docs/SETUP-COMPLETE.org for clarity

New Automation:
- Added scripts/lint-org.el: Emacs Lisp script for org-lint validation
- Added 'make lint-org' target to automate org file syntax checking
- Lint script recursively checks all .org files in repository
- Exit code 0 for clean files, 1 if warnings found

Impact:
- All documentation links now work correctly after docs/ reorganization
- Automated validation prevents broken links and org syntax errors
- No changes to experiment code or functionality
- Clean working tree maintained throughout
