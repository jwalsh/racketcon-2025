* Overview

BoxCast videos from RacketCon 2025 are protected and cannot be directly downloaded with yt-dlp due to authentication requirements.

* URLs

* Issue: Protected Streams

The HLS streams return =403 Forbidden= when accessed directly. BoxCast requires:
1. Valid session cookies
2. Proper referrer headers
3. Possibly signed URLs with expiration

* Alternative Download Methods

** Method 1: Browser Recording
1. Open video in browser (Firefox/Chrome)
2. Use browser extension like "Video DownloadHelper"
3. Or use browser DevTools to find authenticated stream URL

** Method 2: Screen/Audio Recording
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Using ffmpeg to record system audio (macOS)
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i ":BlackHole 2ch" \
  -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k racketcon-day1.mp3
#+END_SRC

** Method 3: YouTube Upload
Check if RacketCon organizers upload to YouTube:
- Search: "RacketCon 2025"
- Official channel may have recordings

** Method 4: Contact Organizers
Email RacketCon organizers to request direct download links or ask about YouTube uploads.

* Tools Setup

** UV Environment
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Install yt-dlp via uv
uv add yt-dlp

# Try download (will likely fail with 403)
uv run yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 <URL> -o "output.%(ext)s"
#+END_SRC

* Failed Attempts Log

** 2025-10-05: yt-dlp with various options
- BoxCast extractor broken (no video formats found)
- Direct HLS URLs return 403 Forbidden
- Added headers (Referer, Origin) - still 403
- Tried both Day 1 and Day 2 URLs

Error:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ERROR: [BoxCastVideo] a4he0hwzawgcoyotxmkn: No video formats found!

#+END_EXAMPLE

* Next Steps
